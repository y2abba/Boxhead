PROJECT TITLE: Spherehead

1. Authors: Yameen Abba, Stanley Chan, Kelvin Mo, Steven Lin

2. Data Structures:
We have used ArrayLists in this project to store the highscores along with the names
of the players who had attained the highscore.

3. Recursive Sorting Algorithm
We have used MergeSort for our project in order to sort the scores to create a high scores
page for our players to see. This method can be viewed in the Scores class.

4. We found it quite a challenge to 
-code the boundaries in which the player can move around, in other words, the boundaries
to prevent the player from phasing through the walls
-coding the platforms/blocks, we thought we had to add the objects manually and perform
trial and error to see where the coordinates of the blocks had to be, 
but then we thought about how we could just type letters to declare where the coordinates 
had to reside, which eneded up working nicely for us
-figuring out how to swap weapons and allow the user to have a multitude of weapon
variety to choose from, problems particularly stemmed from the side of inheritance
of classes
-implementing the recursive sort
